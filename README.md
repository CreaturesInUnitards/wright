# Wright

Hot reloading of js, css and static assets with fallback to regular refresh.
Wright tries to be framework and build system agnostic. You should be able to use it wether you use react, angular, mithril, rollup, browserify etc.

Currently only works with Chrome, and tested on OSX & Windows 10.

## CLI API
```
npm install -g wright
```
Using wright as a cli makes it easy to set your project up with npm scripts or similar systems.


## Javascript API
```
npm install -D wright
```
Using wright with javascript is great if you have complex build steps or some

## Examples

- Mithril
